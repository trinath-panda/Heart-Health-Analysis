This project uses the sashelp.heart dataset to study heart health, identify risk factors for heart disease, examine mortality causes and trends, and explore relationshipsamong key variables.
The goal is to derive insights and recommendations that can help improve heart health.

**Project Components**
1. Data Preparation
Import and Cleaning: Load the dataset, handle missing values, and address data inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examine data distributions and identify potential outliers.

2. Statistical Analysis
Correlation Analysis: Explore relationships among numerical variables like age, cholesterol, and blood pressure.
Comparative Analysis: Use t-tests or chi-square tests to compare groups (e.g., smokers vs. non-smokers).
Regression Analysis: Build logistic regression models to predict heart disease risk.
Survival Analysis: Examine factors affecting survival and mortality trends.

3. Visualization
Create visualizations like scatter plots, box plots, and histograms to understand data patterns.
Generate survival curves to visualize differences in survival based on factors like gender and smoking.

4. Reporting and Recommendations
Summarize key findings from the analysis.
Provide recommendations for improving heart health based on the results.
Identify areas for further research and discuss any limitations.
